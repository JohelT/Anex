       "      <td>Giovanni needs $180 to buy a bike. he already has $105 saved up which means that he already has some of the money he needs. we need to find out how many hours he needs to work to get his bike if he gets 15 dollars per hour. So I decided to subtract 105 dollars from the 180 dollars because he already has that much saved up and we need to find out how many more hours he needs to work to get his bike. subtracting works here because we can get closer to how much money we need which can get us closer to how many hours are required subtracting is a math strategy that is used to see how much of something you have left by taking away an amount. So by subtracting the 105 dollars, we can get an answer of 75 dollars as our difference. I also checked this answer by adding the 105 dollars plus our difference which is 75 and got 180.  However, they are asking how many hours and not how much money. He gets 15 dollars per hour so by dividing which is splitting up numbers into groups we can find out how many hours he needs to work in this case, we would need to divide by 15 because that is how much he earns per hour. This way every group of 15s is an hour. So I can find out how many hours he needs. Here I kept on adding 15 to find out how many 15s I needed to add to get to 75. This way I can find out that Giovanni needs to work 5 more hours which is how many groups of 15s until I get to 75.</td>\n",

So I decided to subtract 105 dollars from the 180 dollars because he already has that much saved up and we need to find out how many more hours he needs to work to get his bike. subtracting works here because we can get closer to how much money we need which can get us closer to how many hours are required subtracting is a math strategy that is used to see how much of something you have left by taking away an amount. So by subtracting the 105 dollars, we can get an answer of 75 dollars as our difference. I also checked this answer by adding the 105 dollars plus our difference which is 75 and got 180.  However, they are asking how many hours and not how much money. He gets 15 dollars per hour so by dividing which is splitting up numbers into groups we can find out how many hours he needs to work in this case, we would need to divide by 15 because that is how much he earns per hour. This way every group of 15s is an hour. So I can find out how many hours he needs. Here I kept on adding 15 to find out how many 15s I needed to add to get to 75.

He gets 15 dollars per hour so by dividing which is splitting up numbers into groups we can find out how many hours he needs to work in this case, we would need to divide by 15 because that is how much he earns per hour. This way every group of 15s is an hour. So I can find out how many hours he needs. Here I kept on adding 15 to find out how many 15s I needed to add to get to 75.

Since 15 multiplied by 12 is equal to 180$, and he has already saved up 15 multiplied by 7$, which equals 105$ total, and 105 subtracted from 180 is equivelant to $75. And because, 15 multiplied by 5 is equivelant to 75, and he is making 15$ per hour, he needs to work for 5 more hours, in order to afford the bike. The reason I got this answer is because the bike costs 180$, which equals 15 multiplied by 12, and he has already saved 15 multiplied by 7$, which equals 105$, than he needs to work for 5 more hours because 15 muliplied by 5 equals 75, and he needs to make 75$ more, because if you subtract 105$ from the amount he needs, to buy the bike which is 180,  you get 75$, so he needs 75$ more.</td>\n",

       "1  Giovanni needs $180 to buy a bike. he already has $105 saved up which means that he already has some of the money he needs. we need to find out how many hours he needs to work to get his bike if he gets 15 dollars per hour. So I decided to subtract 105 dollars from the 180 dollars because he already has that much saved up and we need to find out how many more hours he needs to work to get his bike. subtracting works here because we can get closer to how much money we need which can get us closer to how many hours are required subtracting is a math strategy that is used to see how much of something you have left by taking away an amount. So by subtracting the 105 dollars, we can get an answer of 75 dollars as our difference. I also checked this answer by adding the 105 dollars plus our difference which is 75 and got 180.  However, they are asking how many hours and not how much money. He gets 15 dollars per hour so by dividing which is splitting up numbers into groups we can find out how many hours he needs to work in this case, we would need to divide by 15 because that is how much he earns per hour. This way every group of 15s is an hour. So I can find out how many hours he needs. Here I kept on adding 15 to find out how many 15s I needed to add to get to 75. This way I can find out that Giovanni needs to work 5 more hours which is how many groups of 15s until I get to 75.    \n",

So by subtracting the 105 dollars, we can get an answer of 75 dollars as our difference. I also checked this answer by adding the 105 dollars plus our difference which is 75 and got 180.  However, they are asking how many hours and not how much money. He gets 15 dollars per hour so by dividing which is splitting up numbers into groups we can find out how many hours he needs to work in this case, we would need to divide by 15 because that is how much he earns per hour. This way every group of 15s is an hour. So I can find out how many hours he needs. Here I kept on adding 15 to find out how many 15s I needed to add to get to 75. This way I can find out that Giovanni needs to work 5 more hours which is how many groups of 15s until I get to 75.    \n",
       "1  Giovanni needs $180 to buy a bike. he already has $105 saved up which means that he already has some of the money he needs. we need to find out how many hours he needs to work to get his bike if he gets 15 dollars per hour. So I decided to subtract 105 dollars from the 180 dollars because he already has that much saved up and we need to find out how many more hours he needs to work to get his bike. subtracting works here because we can get closer to how much money we need which can get us closer to how many hours are required subtracting is a math strategy that is used to see how much of something you have left by taking away an amount.

And because, 15 multiplied by 5 is equivelant to 75, and he is making 15$ per hour, he needs to work for 5 more hours, in order to afford the bike. The reason I got this answer is because the bike costs 180$, which equals 15 multiplied by 12, and he has already saved 15 multiplied by 7$, which equals 105$, than he needs to work for 5 more hours because 15 muliplied by 5 equals 75, and he needs to make 75$ more, because if you subtract 105$ from the amount he needs, to buy the bike which is 180,  you get 75$, so he needs 75$ more.   \n",
